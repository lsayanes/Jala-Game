This is a framebuffer that I am developing for my Linux and Windows applications. It is entity oriented but it is far from being an ECS (entity-component systems)

### Folders:
**Components:** Entity stuff<br>
* **Component.h:** It's just a base class that for now stores the type of component created.<br>
* **Physics.h:** It is a structure that contains everything related to physics, such as velocity, position and area of the entity.<br>
* **Properties.h:** size, alpha channel, width, height... etc.</sub><br>
